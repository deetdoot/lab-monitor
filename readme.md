## Overview
This project uses advanced YOLO (You Only Look Once) computer vision models to detect and monitor students in a laboratory environment.

**Objectives:**
- Real-time detection of students entering and exiting the lab via video feeds.
- Accurate counting of students present at any time.
- Tracking and summarizing each student's duration inside the lab.

## Features
- Robust and efficient object detection using YOLO models.
- Logs entry and exit events for each detected student.
- Calculates and reports total time spent by each student in the lab.
- Provides summarized analytics for lab usage and occupancy trends.

## Applications
- Automated attendance tracking.
- Lab resource management and optimization.
- Security and compliance monitoring.

## Technologies
- Python (or relevant language)
- OpenCV for video processing
- YOLOv5/YOLOv8 (or specified YOLO version) for object detection

> **Note:**  
> This system is designed with privacy and ethical considerations in mind, ensuring that only necessary data is collected and processed.
