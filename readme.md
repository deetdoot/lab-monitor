/**
 * @project Student Lab Presence Detection using YOLO
 *
 * @overview
 * This project leverages state-of-the-art YOLO (You Only Look Once) computer vision models to detect and monitor students within a laboratory environment. The primary objectives are:
 *   - Real-time detection of students entering and exiting the lab using video feeds.
 *   - Accurate counting of the number of students present at any given time.
 *   - Tracking and summarizing the duration of each student's stay inside the lab.
 *
 * @features
 * - Utilizes YOLO models for robust and efficient object detection.
 * - Maintains a log of entry and exit events for each detected student.
 * - Computes and reports the total time each student spends in the lab.
 * - Provides summarized analytics for lab usage and occupancy trends.
 *
 * @applications
 * - Automated attendance tracking.
 * - Lab resource management and optimization.
 * - Security and compliance monitoring.
 *
 * @technologies
 * - Python (or relevant language)
 * - OpenCV for video processing
 * - YOLOv5/YOLOv8 (or specified YOLO version) for object detection
 *
 * @note
 * This system is designed with privacy and ethical considerations in mind, ensuring that only necessary data is collected and processed.
